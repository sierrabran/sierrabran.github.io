<h1>Hosts Review</h1>
<h2>First Website Host</h2>
<h2><a href="http://www.godaddy.com">godaddy.com</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Cost:</b> $2.99 for first year and $18.99 after that. Two year purchase required.</li>
  <li><b>Host Services:</b>GoDaddy offers things other than domains, such as: marketing tools and even ways to invest.</li>
  <li><b>Domain Services:</b> This website will host .com, .co, .site, .net, .xyz, .me, .shop, and .pro</li>
  <li><b>Look of website:</b>This website has a clean and organized look that seems to target people who are serious and may already know what they're doing.</li>
</ul>
<p>This site would be my <b>first</b> option because the website really appeals to me and it has affordable options.</p>
<h2>Second Website Host</h2>
<h2><a href="http://www.hostgator.com">hostgator.com</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Cost:</b> This website offers three different plans ranging from $2.75/month to $5.25/month.</li>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Hatchling Plan:</b></li>
<ul>
  <li> $2.75 per month.</li>
  <li> Single website</li>
</ul>
    <li><b>Baby Plan:</b></li>

</ul>
    <li><b>Business Plan:</b>
<ul>
  <li>$5.25 per month.</li>
  <li>Unlimited websites</li>
</ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <li><b>Host Services:</b>HostGator offers shared hosting, website builing, and WordPress hosting.</li>
  <li><b>Domain Services:</b>This website offers all kinds of domains to choose from and you can even transfer one you already have. </li>
  <li><b>Look of website:</b>Nice looking website with a cute mascot. Looks like the website targets beginners and pros. </li>
</ul>
<p>This site would be my <b>second</b> option because the website looks less serious and there are cheaper options on GoDaddy.</p>
<h2>Third Website Host</h2>
<h2><a href="http://www.siteground.com">siteground.com</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Cost:</b>This website also offers three different plans. They range from $3.99/month to $10.69/month.</li>
  <ol>
    <li><b>StartUp:</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li> $3.99 per month. </li>
      <li> 10 GB web space. </li>
      <li> About 10,000 visits monthly. </li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>GrowBig (Best Seller):</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li> $6.69 per month. </li>
      <li> 20 GB web space. </li>
      <li> About 100,000 visits monthly. </li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>GoGeek:</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li> $10.69 per month. </li>
      <li> 40 GB web space. </li>
      <li> About 400,000 visits monthly. </li>
    </ul>
  </ol>
  <li><b>Host Services:</b>SiteGround has many hosting options that include: web, wordpress, woocommerce, cloud, and reseller hosting.</li>
  <li><b>Domain Services:</b>This website only had a few options for domain names and they seemed much more expensive than the other two websites.</li>
  <li><b>Look of website:</b>I don't like the look of this website as much as the others. Seems like it is marketed more for beginners.</li>
</ul>
<p>This site would be my <b>third</b> option because it is more expensive and the website does not appeal as much to me. </p>
