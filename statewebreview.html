<h1>Review of State Websites</h1>
<h2>First State Website: Alaska</h2>
<h2><a href="https://alaska.gov/">alaska.gov</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Color and Design:</b>I like the color and design of this website. The theme is this navy blue color and all the colors look good together. There are also mountains in the background and a picture of beautiful mountains, front and center. The one thing about this website is that it looks slightly outdated. Also, the actual website on the webpage is much smaller than all the others. The others go from the very left side to the very right side while this one has a much bigger margin.</li>
  <li><b>Loading Time:</b>This website loaded very quickly.</li>
  <li><b>Menu Quality:</b>This website has a nice and easy to use menu. There are many categories that make it easy to find where you're going. If you are still unable to find what you are looking for, there is a search bar right at the top of the home page, where it's expected to be.</li>
  <li><b>Mobile or Larger:</b>This website looked really good and formatted well on mobile and it did ok when zooming in a bunch.</li>
</ul>
<p>This site is my <b>third favorite</b> state site because it is nice and functional, but looks a little outdated. It could use some work, but besides aesthetics, it's good.</p>
<h2>Second State Website: Delaware</h2>
<h2><a href="https://delaware.gov/">delaware.gov</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Color and Design:</b> I really like the layout of this website. The website has a very modern and clean look. It has a nice blue theme and a pretty picture that stands out. The picture is slightly blurry though. I really don't like the logo for this website. It looks like they just went through different fonts to see which "D" they should use as their logo. There is a big search bar front and center and a lot of news on the front page. Overall, this website looks great, but I would change a few things.</li>
  <li><b>Loading Time:</b>This website loaded very quickly.</li>
  <li><b>Menu Quality:</b>This website has an interesting, unique menu, but I don't like it that much. It is in the right side of the screen and you can't even see it if you don't have your pointer over the bullet points. If I need to find somethign I would stick to using the search bar instead of going through the menu.</li>
  <li><b>Mobile or Larger:</b>This website looks great on mobile and it looks good zoomed in.</li>
</ul>
<p>This site is my <b>second favorite</b> because of the modern and clean look it has. There are a few small changes that I would make toit, but other than that, I think it's really great.</p>
<h2>Third State Website: Florida</h2>
<h2><a href="https://www.myflorida.com/">myflorida.com</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Color and Design:</b>My first question is, why is this their website name. Did someone already have florida.gov? This website isn't even a .gov which makes it seem unoffical compared to the others. My second question is, how hard is it to get a picture that isn't blurry? The whole background of this website is a beautiful picture of the Florida ocean, except it is horrible quality. One thing I did like about this website was their logo. It is unique compared to the others and full of detail and color. This website has a good base with a nice theme, colors, and logo, but it needs a lot of work. It is very minimal, with almost nothing to show on the home page. </li>
  <li><b>Loading Time:</b>This website loaded very quickly.</li>
  <li><b>Menu Quality:</b>There is no menu to be found on this website. There is only a huge search bar and an option that says "Contact Us". </li>
  <li><b>Mobile or Larger:</b>This website looks good on mobile, but not great when zoomed in on the website.</li>
</ul>
<p>This site is my <b>second least favorite</b> state website because it is very bare. There needs to be a lot more added, but they have the colors and theme down.</p>
<h2>Fourth State Website: Illinois</h2>
<h2><a href="https://www.illinois.gov/">illinois.gov</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Color and Design:</b>This website looks very nice. There is a pretty picture in the background that is not blurry at all. There is a blue theme that looks great and their logo is unique and cool. I think this website was made very well. Something cool and different about this website would be the virtual assistant feature. It works just like a search bar, but looks a little bit cooler and unique.  </li>
  <li><b>Loading Time:</b>This website loaded very quickly.</li>
  <li><b>Menu Quality:</b>There is a menu, but it is not a drop down, which I don't like. If I needed to find soemthing I would probably just end up searching it instead of looking through the menu. Overall, I found this menu well made and very pleasing to the eye.</li>
  <li><b>Mobile or Larger:</b>This website looks good both on mobile and zoomed in in the website.</li>
</ul>
<p>This site is my <b>favorite</b> because it is very pleasing to look at and very well put together. It has a new, clean look and is very functional.</p>
<h2>Fifth State Website: Nebraska</h2>
<h2><a href="https://www.nebraska.gov/">nebraska.gov</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Color and Design:</b>First of all the bakcground picture on this website is very blurry. I don't know if there is some reasoning behind that, or if whoever made this website was just too lazy to care. There is also no specific color theme to this website, or if there is, I don't like it. Another thing I don't like is the logo. By far the worst logo out of the five. It isn't creative and it looks like the logo of a news station. This website is also formatted weridly. There is a search bar front and center and right below that there is statistics about the state. I found that very weird and can imagine every person that goes on that website scrolling right past that. One unique feature of this website is their Twitter. They have their Twitter handle as the header and then have three tweets from the account following that. After you scroll for a little bit, there is just a huge blank space on the left side of the website. Overall, I think this website is pretty boring and poorly made.</li>
  <li><b>Loading Time:</b>This website loaded quickly.</li>
  <li><b>Menu Quality:</b>The one good thing about this website would havee to be its menu. The menu was a dropdown and was well orgaized and formatted. I liked how if you hovered your mouse over any of the five options, the whole dropdown came up, instead of just the dropdown of the one you were hovering over. </li>
  <li><b>Mobile or Larger:</b>This website does look good and normal on mobile. It looks not as good when zoomed in. </li>
</ul>
<p>This site is my <b>least favorite</b> state website out of the five we looked at. It looked the worst and was weirdly made and formatted.</p>
